'Run as Java application' on eclipse or other IDE for execution


Solution Flow
=============
a)Main.java contains 'static void main(String[] args)' to be invoked by JVM.This main method
creates an instance of Parser.java & passes a Scanner object to it. Currently System.in is 
used.

b)Parser.java is the entry point & diverts incoming input lines to different processors based on 
regex matches of the input. If no regex match is found,prints appropriate message.

c)The different processors that are called from Parser are

i) NumeralTranslator.java handles the translation of galaxy numbers to roman and 
   roman to arabic
   
ii) MetalPriceCalculator.java performs the calculation of a single metal unit 
	based on the input

iii) QuestionProcessor.java processes the 'how much is......' question & 
     'how many Credits is...' question & generates o/p
     
All 3 processors implement Processor.java interfaces


Entities
========
There are 3 entities used in solution
a) GalaxyNumerals.java - stores translated(roman) galaxy numerals
b) RomanNumerals.java - stores translated(arabic) roman character.contains helper method
for translation of a Roman numeral to Arabic counterpart.
c) MetalPriceChart - stores the unit prices of different metals based on input

Additional
==========
GalaxyLogger.java is used to generate o/p & error msgs
InputRegex.java is an enum that hold regexes for expected types of input
